# Hashtables

### is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type,
a structure that can map keys to values.
A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code,
into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found

## Challenge

Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:

add :
Arguments: key, value
Returns: nothing
This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.

get
Arguments: key
Returns: Value associated with that key in the table.

contains
Arguments: key
Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

hash
Arguments: key
Returns: Index in the collection for that key
